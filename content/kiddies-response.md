Mr. Calzone,

Thanks so much for forwarding this highly incriminating email to me. One
would think that admitting to crimes in an email is a bad idea, but
forwarding that email to the police is a pretty big mistake.

I've been looking into your illegal activities for some time, but before
now you had been covering your tracks two well. Thanks to your email, I was
able to fast track a search warrant for your casino. I will be down there
in about 45 minutes.

Sincerely,

Detective Veronica Marlowe

Big D!

Your "Save the Kiddies" foundation idea is going great. Can you believe
people are actually donating to this scam? We're drawing in almost as much
money from these suckers as we're getting from the meth. Even some of the
girls you are pimping pitched in. Ha!

By the way, we need more muscle for our protection racket. More marks are
refusing payment, and they need some "convincing."
